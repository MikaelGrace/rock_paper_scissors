        <h1>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME</h1>
        <p class="intro">Rock paper scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously 
            forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" 
            (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game 
            originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread 
            throughout the world in the early 20th century.</p>
        <p class="intro">It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining 
            way to pass the time. The neat thing about the game is that almost anybody can pick the rules up in a matter of seconds</p>
